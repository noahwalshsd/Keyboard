# Slim Shady Keyboard
My project is a 65% orthographic mecanical keyboard. It will be more ergonomic than a regular keyboard and mimic a laptop keyboard in its quietness and lack of push depth. 
I needed to get into PCBs. Before this project, I didn't even know what they were or even what PCB meant. I decided to make an ortholinear keyboardbecause I saw them being priced extremely high and I thought I could make it cheaper as my first PCB project. Because it is my first PCB project, I spent well over the suggested time in my learning efforts. I failed many times in nearly everything. I only got the CAD right first try. The cherry on top is that I may qualify for Prototype. 
There is 1 spacebar keycap, 1 3-wide keycap, 5 2-wide keycaps, and 60 small keycaps.
